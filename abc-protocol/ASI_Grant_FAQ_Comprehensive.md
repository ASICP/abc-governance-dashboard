## SECTION 1: GRANT PROGRAM OVERVIEW

### 1.1 What is the ASI Alignment Grant Program?

The ASI Alignment Grant Program provides non-dilutive funding for AI safety research through a Swiss-based governance structure. Unlike traditional venture capital or institutional grants, we don't take equity, demand board seats, or impose publication restrictions. Researchers receive SAT tokens (pegged at $150 USD) that can be immediately converted to fiat currency, maintaining complete autonomy over their research direction.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **No equity dilution** - you keep 100% ownership of your research and any resulting IP
- **Patient capital** - 36-month funding cycles aligned with actual research timelines
- **Open-source mandate** - all funded research remains publicly accessible
- **Swiss neutrality** - governance independent from corporate or national interests
- **Fast decisions** - 60-day timeline from application to award notification

---

### 1.2 What are the grant tiers and typical funding amounts?

We offer three grant tiers designed to support different stages and scales of AI safety research:

#### **Tier 1: Targeted Projects**
- **Budget:** $50,000+ per grant
- **Duration:** 6-12 months
- **Focus:** Specific tools, datasets, proof-of-concept work, pilot studies
- **Board Approval:** Simple majority
- **Example:** Developing a novel interpretability toolkit for transformer models

#### **Tier 2: Applied Research**
- **Budget:** $250,000+ per grant
- **Duration:** 12-24 months
- **Focus:** Applied AI safety research with near-term impact on real-world systems
- **Board Approval:** 2/3 supermajority
- **Example:** Creating scalable oversight mechanisms for large language models in production environments

#### **Tier 3: Transformational Research**
- **Budget:** $1,000,000+ per grant
- **Duration:** 24-36 months
- **Focus:** High-risk, high-reward foundational AI safety research that could reshape the field
- **Board Approval:** Unanimous vote required
- **Example:** Developing fundamentally new approaches to AI alignment that don't rely on reward modeling

---

### 1.3 How does the evaluation and selection process work?

Our evaluation process is designed for transparency and rigor while maintaining a 60-day timeline:

#### **Phase 1: Administrative Review (10-20 business days)**
- Completeness check and eligibility verification
- Budget reasonableness assessment
- Conflict of interest screening
- Incomplete proposals returned with specific feedback

#### **Phase 2: Grant Committee Review (3 weeks)**
- Each proposal assigned to 3 primary reviewers (500+ word evaluations) and 2 secondary reviewers (200+ word evaluations)
- Independent scoring on six criteria (1-10 scale): Scientific Merit, Feasibility, Team Capability, Impact Potential, Budget Reasonableness, Ethical Considerations
- Committee deliberation on top 30-40% of proposals
- Finalists selected by majority committee vote (3-8 finalists depending on tier)

#### **Phase 3: Token Holder Vote (7 days)**
- Finalist proposals published with detailed evaluation summaries
- SAIT token holders with 1%+ of circulating supply cast on-chain votes
- Optional Q&A sessions with finalists
- Simple majority determines winner (institutional participants receive 1.5x vote weight)

#### **Phase 4: Award & Funding (48 hours + 30-60 days)**
- Board confirms vote integrity within 48 hours
- Grant agreement executed with milestone structure
- SAT tokens transferred within 30-60 days

---

### 1.4 What happens if my proposal isn't selected as a finalist?

**We provide substantive feedback to help strengthen future applications:**

#### **All Applicants Receive:**
- Notification of application status within 60 days
- Indication of which phase the application reached

#### **Finalists Who Don't Win Receive:**
- Complete scorecard summary showing strengths and areas for improvement
- Specific reviewer feedback (anonymized)
- Optional 15-minute debrief call with Grant Committee member
- Encouragement to revise and resubmit in future cycles

We recognize that reviewer feedback is invaluable for researchers. Unlike many grant programs that operate as "black boxes," we're committed to helping all applicants understand how their proposals were evaluated and how they can improve.

---

### 1.5 Can I apply directly as a researcher or must my institution apply?

**You can apply either way - this is one of our key differentiators from traditional funding sources.**

#### **Direct-to-Researcher Grants:**
- Individual researchers or small teams can apply directly
- Grant agreement executed with you personally (subject to KYC/AML verification)
- No institutional overhead fees deducted
- Ideal for independent researchers, postdocs, or those wanting maximum flexibility
- You remain responsible for tax implications in your jurisdiction

#### **Institution-Based Grants:**
- Grant flows through your university, research institute, or organization
- Institutional overhead may apply (typically 10-30%, negotiated with institution)
- May be required if you need institutional resources (lab space, equipment, administrative support)
- Institution handles tax documentation and compliance

**Note:** PhD students can apply without supervisor approval if they can demonstrate the capacity to execute the proposed research independently. However, we encourage discussing your application with your advisor as a professional courtesy.

---

### 1.6 What types of costs can grant funds cover?

ASI grants can fund the full spectrum of research expenses:

#### **Eligible Expenses:**
- **Personnel:** Salaries, stipends, research assistants, postdocs
- **Compute Resources:** Cloud computing, GPU clusters, API access for large models
- **Equipment:** Servers, workstations, specialized hardware (must be justified for AI safety research)
- **Data Acquisition:** Dataset licenses, human labeling, data storage
- **Conference & Collaboration:** Travel to present findings, workshops, team meetings
- **Publication Costs:** Open-access fees, preprint servers, data repository hosting
- **Indirect Costs:** Institutional overhead (if applicable), administrative support

#### **Budget Requirements:**
- Provide detailed budget breakdown in your application
- Justify major expenses with specific research needs
- Be realistic about costs - reviewers assess budget reasonableness
- Some flexibility to reallocate within approved budget categories during the grant period (requires notification)

---

### 1.7 How do I demonstrate the 'AI safety' relevance of my research?

AI safety research spans multiple domains. We fund work that directly or indirectly contributes to building more aligned, robust, interpretable, or controllable AI systems. Your proposal should clearly articulate how your research addresses AI safety challenges.

#### **Core AI Safety Areas We Fund:**
- **Alignment Research:** Value learning, reward modeling, human feedback mechanisms, preference learning
- **Robustness & Reliability:** Adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution detection, uncertainty quantification, failure modes
- **Interpretability & Explainability:** Mechanistic interpretability, attention analysis, feature visualization, causal inference
- **AI Governance & Policy:** Technical foundations for policy, audit methodologies, standards development
- **Scalable Oversight:** Debate methods, recursive reward modeling, AI-assisted human evaluation
- **Safety Infrastructure:** Benchmarks, evaluation frameworks, red-teaming tools, safety datasets

#### **In Your Application:**
- Be specific about which safety challenge your research addresses
- Explain the pathway from your research to improved AI safety outcomes
- Acknowledge if your work is exploratory or long-term in nature (we fund both)
- Distinguish your approach from existing work in the field

---

### 1.8 What is the published evaluation rubric?

Transparency is core to our mission. All proposals are evaluated using the same six-criterion rubric (1-10 scale):

#### **1. Scientific Merit & Innovation (Weight: 25%)**
- Does the research ask important questions?
- Is the approach novel or meaningfully different from existing work?
- Could it lead to significant advances in AI safety?

#### **2. Feasibility & Approach Quality (Weight: 20%)**
- Is the methodology sound and clearly articulated?
- Are the proposed experiments achievable within the timeline?
- Are there clear success criteria and milestones?

#### **3. Team Capability & Track Record (Weight: 20%)**
- Does the team have relevant expertise and experience?
- Is there evidence of previous research accomplishments?
- For early-career researchers: Do advisors/mentors provide adequate support?

#### **4. Impact Potential on AI Safety (Weight: 25%)**
- How directly does this work contribute to safer AI systems?
- Could the findings be adopted by AI labs or influence the field?
- What's the scope of impact (technical breakthrough vs. incremental improvement)?

#### **5. Budget Reasonableness (Weight: 5%)**
- Are costs justified and appropriate for the proposed work?
- Is there evidence of efficient resource utilization?

#### **6. Ethical Considerations & Risk Management (Weight: 5%)**
- Are potential risks (dual-use, misuse, unintended consequences) identified?
- Are there appropriate safeguards?
- Does the work comply with data privacy and human subjects requirements?

The complete rubric with detailed scoring guidance is available on the ASI website. Finalists receive scorecards showing how reviewers rated them on each criterion.

## SECTION 2: OPERATIONS & LOGISTICS

### 2.1 What is the legal entity behind grant contracts?

#### **Current Structure (through 2025):**
ASI operates as a for-profit LLC incorporated in Texas, USA. This structure allows us to rapidly establish operations while we prepare for Swiss incorporation.

#### **Future Structure (2026 launch):**
Before the grant program launches in 2026, ASI will be re-incorporated in Switzerland following the same legal framework that governs the ETH AI Center. This Swiss structure provides:

- **Swiss Neutrality:** Independent from corporate or national interests, positioned as a neutral arbiter of AI safety research funding
- **Regulatory Certainty:** Switzerland's clear framework for AI research organizations, adherence to Council of Europe AI Convention principles
- **Academic Credibility:** Following the model of ETH Zurich, one of Europe's premier AI research institutions
- **Global Accessibility:** Swiss legal status facilitates international grant agreements without US sanctions or export control complications

All grant agreements will be executed under Swiss law once the incorporation is complete. This structure has been specifically designed to maximize researcher trust and institutional confidence.

---

### 2.2 How do SAT token payments work?

Grants are awarded in SAT tokens, which are stablecoins pegged at $150 USD and backed by a diversified basket of commodities and stablecoins (150% over-collateralized).

#### **Payment Process:**
- Grant award approved → SAT tokens transferred to your designated wallet within 30-60 days
- You can immediately convert SAT to fiat currency (USD, EUR, CHF, etc.) through integrated payment processors
- No lock-up periods or vesting schedules - funds are yours to use immediately
- For milestone-based grants (Tier 2 & 3), subsequent payments released upon milestone completion

#### **Currency Options:**
- Although SAT is USD-pegged, we partner with payment processors (Wise, Deel) to enable conversion to your local currency
- For institutional grants, your institution can handle foreign exchange as part of their standard treasury operations
- We provide guidance for setting up wallets and executing conversions - no prior crypto experience required

#### **Why tokens instead of direct wire transfer?**
The token mechanism enables transparent, programmable disbursement tied to the ASIP ecosystem. However, from your perspective as a grantee, the experience is functionally equivalent to receiving a wire transfer - just with a brief conversion step.

---

### 2.3 What is the KYC/AML verification process?

As a Swiss-based financial intermediary (upon 2026 incorporation), ASI is required to conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) verification for all grant recipients. This is standard practice for organizations disbursing funds internationally.

#### **For Individual Researchers:**
You'll be asked to submit:
- Government-issued ID (passport, national ID card, or driver's license)
- Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement, or lease agreement within last 3 months)
- Tax identification number from your jurisdiction
- **Processing time:** 3-5 business days
- **Cost:** Approximately $50 per recipient (absorbed by ASI, not charged to you)

#### **For Institutional Grants:**
Your institution submits organizational documents:
- Certificate of incorporation or equivalent
- Proof of current good standing
- Identification of beneficial owners (if applicable)
- Tax documentation (W-9, W-8BEN-E, or equivalent)
- Most universities and research institutes have completed this process with other funders - your grants office will know what's needed

#### **Service Provider:**
We use Sumsub, a leading KYC/AML verification service with bank-grade security and GDPR compliance. Your information is encrypted and never shared beyond what's legally required.

---

### 2.4 What happens if I can't meet a milestone or need to extend my timeline?

Research rarely goes exactly as planned. We understand that AI safety research is exploratory, and we've built flexibility into our milestone structure.

#### **Milestone Review Process:**
- For Tier 2 & 3 grants: You submit quarterly progress reports with milestone deliverables
- Grant Committee reviews within 21 days
- Board approves next payment tranche upon satisfactory progress

#### **If You're Behind Schedule:**
- **Communicate early** - as soon as you realize you might miss a milestone, notify your Grant Program Lead
- Provide explanation and revised plan (30-60 day remediation period granted)
- **Common acceptable reasons:** Unexpected technical challenges, personnel changes, shifts in research direction based on preliminary findings
- We may adjust milestones collaboratively or extend your timeline by mutual agreement

#### **Persistent Issues:**
- If multiple milestones are consistently missed without acceptable explanation, we may initiate intervention
- **Options include:** Modified milestones, reduced scope with proportional budget adjustment, transfer to different research lead (if team-based), or grant termination with return of unused funds

#### **Philosophy:**
We're here to support successful research, not to punish setbacks. The milestone structure exists to ensure accountability, not to create unrealistic pressure. Transparent communication is key.

---

### 2.5 Who is the Grant Program Lead and what do they do?

Each active grant is assigned a Grant Program Lead from the ASI operations team. Think of them as your main point of contact and advocate within ASI.

#### **Responsibilities:**
- **Onboarding:** Walk you through grant agreement, payment setup, milestone expectations, reporting requirements
- **Progress Monitoring:** Review quarterly reports, answer questions, provide feedback on deliverables
- **Problem-Solving:** Help navigate challenges, facilitate timeline adjustments, coordinate with Grant Committee as needed
- **Dissemination Support:** Assist with publication planning, connect you with other ASIP-funded researchers, highlight your work in ASI communications
- **Impact Tracking:** Document research outputs (papers, tools, citations), compile success stories for public reporting

#### **Communication:**
- Your Grant Program Lead will schedule quarterly check-ins (30-60 minutes)
- They're available via email for ad-hoc questions throughout your grant period
- They do NOT micromanage your research - their role is supportive, not supervisory

---

### 2.6 What reporting requirements do I have as a grantee?

We've designed reporting requirements to balance accountability with minimal burden on researchers.

#### **Quarterly Progress Reports (Tier 2 & 3 grants):**
- 2-3 page narrative summary of progress
- Key findings or preliminary results
- Challenges encountered and mitigation strategies
- Budget expenditure update
- Plans for next quarter

#### **Milestone Deliverables:**
- Specified in your grant agreement
- May include: Technical reports, datasets, code repositories, draft papers, prototype tools
- Reviewed by Grant Committee within 21 days

#### **Annual Impact Report (All tiers):**
- Publications (preprints, peer-reviewed papers, conference presentations)
- Code/tools released
- Collaborations established
- Media coverage or policy impact (if any)
- Citations or adoption by other researchers

#### **Final Grant Report:**
- Comprehensive summary of research outcomes
- Assessment of original aims vs. actual achievements
- Lessons learned
- Plans for future work or commercialization (if applicable)

---

### 2.7 Can I hire team members or subcontract work with grant funds?

Yes, absolutely. Grant funds can be used to build your research team or engage specialized expertise.

#### **Personnel You Can Hire:**
- Research assistants (undergraduate or graduate students)
- Postdoctoral researchers
- Software engineers or ML engineers
- Data annotators or research coordinators
- Consultants for specialized tasks (e.g., statistical analysis, ethics review)

#### **Requirements:**
- All personnel costs must be included in your original budget or approved as a reallocation
- If hiring through your institution, they must comply with institutional HR policies
- If hiring directly (individual grants), you're responsible for employment law compliance in your jurisdiction
- Team members may need to complete KYC verification if receiving >$10,000 directly

#### **Subcontracting:**
- You can subcontract specific components to other researchers or organizations
- Subcontractors must agree to ASI's open-source publication mandate
- Subcontracts >$50,000 require board pre-approval
- You remain primarily responsible for grant deliverables

---

### 2.8 What happens if I want to change my research direction mid-grant?

Research often takes unexpected turns. We support pivots when they're scientifically justified.

#### **Minor Changes (No approval needed):**
- Adjusting specific methods or techniques
- Shifting emphasis between project components
- Responding to preliminary findings

#### **Major Changes (Require approval):**
- Fundamental shift in research question or approach
- Significant budget reallocation (>20% between categories)
- Change in project scope or expected deliverables

#### **Process for Major Changes:**
1. Notify your Grant Program Lead with written justification
2. Explain scientific rationale for the pivot
3. Grant Committee reviews within 14 days
4. Board approves if still aligned with AI safety mission and original grant tier

#### **What We Look For:**
- Pivot maintains AI safety relevance
- New direction has comparable or greater potential impact
- Change reflects genuine scientific insight, not loss of motivation
- Timeline and budget remain reasonable

We encourage researchers to follow the most promising scientific directions. However, we need to ensure that pivots don't fundamentally alter the grant's purpose or exceed the approved scope.

---

## SECTION 3: STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### 3.1 How is ASI different from other AI safety funders?

The AI safety funding landscape includes several major players. Here's how we compare:

#### **Open Philanthropy (OpenPhil)**
- **Similarities:** Large grants ($500K-$5M+), long timelines (2-5 years), high-impact research focus
- **Differences:** OpenPhil primarily funds established organizations and senior researchers; ASI funds individuals and emerging researchers equally. OpenPhil's decision-making is internal; ASI involves community voting on finalists.

#### **Future of Life Institute (FLI)**
- **Similarities:** Non-profit structure, global researcher accessibility, AI safety focus
- **Differences:** FLI emphasizes existential risk and policy; ASI funds broader technical safety work. FLI typically awards smaller grants ($50K-$200K); ASI offers larger tiers ($50K-$1M+).

#### **Long-Term Future Fund (LTFF)**
- **Similarities:** Supports individual researchers, relatively fast decisions (4-6 weeks)
- **Differences:** LTFF focuses on longtermist EA projects (broader than AI safety); grants typically <$100K. ASI is AI-safety specific with larger grant tiers. LTFF uses internal committee decisions; ASI uses tokenized voting.

#### **Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF)**
- **Similarities:** Support for speculative/exploratory research, individual grantees welcome
- **Differences:** SFF operates twice-yearly rounds with variable funding amounts; ASI provides rolling applications with defined tiers. SFF funding is philanthropic capital; ASI funding is backed by tokenized reserves.

#### **ASI's Unique Value Proposition:**
- **Swiss Neutrality:** Not tied to any corporation, government, or ideological ecosystem
- **Tokenized Governance:** SAIT holders vote on grant winners, providing distributed peer review
- **Non-Dilutive Capital:** No equity taken, ever - you commercialize later without ASI involvement
- **Patient Timelines:** 36-month funding cycles match research reality, not VC pressure
- **Fast Decisions:** 60-day timeline from submission to award notification
- **Direct-to-Researcher Option:** No institutional approval needed if you don't want it

---

### 3.2 Can I take venture capital funding after receiving an ASI grant?

**Absolutely yes. In fact, this is by design.**

ASI grants are intended to fund pure research that de-risks commercialization pathways. If your research leads to a product or company, we actively encourage you to seek traditional VC funding for commercial development.

#### **The "Rotate Out" Model:**
- **Research Phase:** ASI funds foundational safety research with no strings attached
- **Commercialization Phase:** If you want to build a product/company, you pursue VC, take equity dilution for growth capital
- **ASI's Position:** We have ZERO claim on your IP, equity, or commercial success. The research remains open-source; the company you build is entirely yours.

#### **Example Scenario:**
You receive an ASI grant to develop novel interpretability methods for LLMs. Two years later, your research produces a breakthrough technique. You decide to commercialize it as a SaaS product for AI labs. You raise a $3M seed round from Sequoia at a $15M valuation. ASI has no involvement in this transaction and takes no equity or revenue share. Your published research remains open for others to build upon.

#### **Why This Model Works:**
- Pure research and commercial development require different funding structures
- ASI eliminates the "friends and family" equity dilution that happens too early in many research-to-startup journeys
- VCs don't want to fund 18-24 months of uncertain research - but they DO want to fund proven technology
- ASI's mission is maximum AI safety research, not financial returns

---

### 3.3 What if a major AI lab decides to launch a similar program?

This is a legitimate strategic concern. If OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, or others launched large-scale grant programs, they'd have deeper pockets than ASI. Here's our competitive positioning:

#### **ASI's Defensible Moats:**

**1. Swiss Neutrality**
- Corporate labs have inherent conflicts of interest. If OpenAI funds your interpretability research, will you feel comfortable publishing findings that reveal GPT-5 vulnerabilities? ASI's Swiss governance eliminates this concern.

**2. Non-Corporate Governance**
- ASI's board cannot be influenced by quarterly earnings, product roadmaps, or competitive dynamics. Our only fiduciary duty is to AI safety research, not to shareholder returns.

**3. Tokenized Transparency**
- All grant decisions, voting records, and treasury operations are on-chain and publicly auditable. Corporate grant programs lack this radical transparency.

**4. Global Accessibility**
- US-based labs face sanctions compliance and export control restrictions. ASI's Swiss structure enables funding for researchers globally without geopolitical constraints (subject only to Swiss law).

**5. Researcher Autonomy**
- Corporate labs may subtly pressure grantees toward research directions aligned with their models or business interests. ASI has no products, so we have no agenda beyond safety.

#### **Market Positioning:**
We're not trying to be the largest funder. We're positioning as the most neutral, transparent, and researcher-friendly funder. Some researchers will prefer corporate funding for various reasons (access to compute, collaboration opportunities, prestige). Others will value ASI's independence. Both can coexist.

---

### 3.4 How do you prevent grants from going to "friends of advisors" or insiders?

This is a critical governance concern, and we've built multiple safeguards:

#### **Conflict of Interest Policy:**
Grant Committee members MUST recuse from evaluating:
- Collaborators (past 3 years)
- Personal relationships (family, close friends, former advisees)
- Financial interests (co-founders, consultants, equity holders)
- Professional competitors (to avoid bias against rivals)

Conflicts must be disclosed at application assignment, before any evaluation begins. Undisclosed conflicts discovered later result in immediate removal from committee + potential legal action.

#### **Anonymous Review Stage:**
- Initial scoring (Phase 1) is done with applicant names and institutions redacted where feasible
- This reduces reputation bias in early-stage evaluation
- Full proposals are visible to committee during deliberation, but initial rankings based on blind review

#### **Token Holder Voting:**
- Grant finalists are selected by the committee, but winners are chosen by SAIT token holders
- Token holders with 1%+ of circulating supply can review all finalist proposals and cast votes
- This distributed decision-making prevents any single committee member from steering awards to preferred candidates

#### **Public Transparency:**
- All grant awards are publicly announced with winner names, institutions, and project abstracts
- Community can scrutinize patterns (e.g., disproportionate awards to one institution)
- Annual reports include diversity metrics (geographic, institutional, career stage)

---

### 3.5 How do you ensure token holders vote based on merit, not reputation?

This is a known challenge with any voting system. We acknowledge that token holders may be influenced by the reputation of famous researchers. Here's our mitigation strategy:

#### **Published Rubric Enforcement:**
- Grant Committee provides detailed scorecards for each finalist
- Token holders can see exactly how each proposal scored on: Scientific Merit, Feasibility, Team Capability, Impact Potential, Budget, Ethics
- Committee narratives explain strengths and weaknesses objectively

#### **Institutional Participant Multiplier:**
- Verified institutional participants (universities, research institutes, endowments) receive 1.5x vote weight
- Rationale: Institutions have professional diligence teams and are less likely to vote based on hype
- This doesn't eliminate reputation bias but does amplify informed decision-making

#### **Optional Finalist Presentations:**
- Finalists can present their proposals (15 minutes + Q&A) during the voting period
- This allows lesser-known researchers to showcase their ideas compellingly
- Not required - some prefer to let the written proposal speak for itself

#### **Empirical Tracking:**
- We'll publish annual analysis of grant outcomes (publications, citations, real-world impact) correlated with winner profiles
- If we observe systematic underperformance of "famous researcher" grants vs. "unknown researcher" grants, we can adjust governance
- This creates accountability for the voting system itself

#### **Realistic Expectation:**
We cannot eliminate reputation effects entirely - they exist in all grant systems, including traditional peer review. But by combining expert committee screening with distributed token holder voting, we believe we can balance prestige bias with genuine merit evaluation.

---

### 3.6 What if no one wants to buy SAIT tokens at the offering price?

This scenario would impact ASI's ability to fund grants, but we have mitigation strategies:

#### **SAIT Demand Drivers:**
- Institutional participants gain enhanced voting rights (1.5x multiplier)
- Access to early information on cutting-edge AI safety research
- Direct influence on which research gets funded
- Potential for SAIT appreciation if AI safety research becomes more valued

#### **Backup Funding Mechanisms:**
- Initial treasury reserve (30M SAIT, ~$4.5B equivalent in SAT) provides multi-year runway
- Board can adjust token price discovery mechanisms if market conditions change
- SAT reserve can be deployed to fund grants even if SAIT liquidity is low
- Emergency fundraising from aligned institutions if token market fails

#### **Realistic Assessment:**
If crypto winter continues and institutional appetite for AI safety tokens is limited, we may need to:
- Reduce grant budget allocations
- Prioritize Tier 1 grants over Tier 3
- Seek traditional philanthropic capital to supplement tokenized funding
- Demonstrate proof-of-concept with smaller grant cycles before scaling

The tokenized model is innovative but unproven. We're committed to AI safety funding regardless of token market dynamics, and will adapt our funding model if necessary.

---

### 3.7 How do you measure "AI safety impact" for grant outcomes?

This is one of the hardest challenges in grant evaluation. We use multiple metrics while acknowledging the limitations of each:

#### **Quantitative Metrics (Easy to measure, incomplete picture):**
- **Publications:** Peer-reviewed papers, preprints, conference presentations
- **Citations:** How often is ASI-funded work cited by other researchers?
- **Code/Tool Adoption:** GitHub stars, downloads, integration into other projects
- **Dataset Usage:** How many downstream projects use ASI-funded datasets?
- **Policy Influence:** References in government reports, standards documents

#### **Qualitative Assessment (Harder to measure, more meaningful):**
- **Technical Breakthroughs:** Did the research enable new capabilities or understanding?
- **Field-Building:** Did it open new research directions or attract new researchers to AI safety?
- **Real-World Deployment:** Have AI labs integrated the findings into production systems?
- **Risk Reduction:** Has the work measurably reduced specific AI safety risks?

#### **Goodhart's Law Awareness:**
"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

We're conscious that overemphasizing citations or publications could incentivize researchers to:
- Pursue incremental work over ambitious projects
- Focus on popular topics over neglected areas
- Prioritize quantity over quality

#### **Our Approach:**
- Use multiple metrics, no single dominant indicator
- Emphasize qualitative peer assessment alongside quantitative data
- Evaluate grants on 3-5 year timelines (not annual reviews)
- Celebrate "productive failures" that advance field knowledge
- Compare impact across similar grant tiers (Tier 1 vs. Tier 1, not Tier 1 vs. Tier 3)

#### **Annual Review Process:**
- External advisory council reviews grant portfolio outcomes
- Identifies successful patterns and failure modes
- Recommends adjustments to evaluation criteria or funding priorities
- Published transparently for community feedback

---

## SECTION 4: LEGAL & REGULATORY

### 4.1 Are ASI grants considered "income" or "gifts" for tax purposes?

**Short answer: It depends on your jurisdiction and employment status. ASI cannot provide tax advice, but we can explain common scenarios.**

#### **United States:**
- **Individual researchers:** Grants are typically taxable income (similar to scholarship or fellowship income)
- You'll receive a 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC from ASI for IRS reporting
- **Institutional grants:** Flow through your university/institute's normal grant accounting (typically exempt if your institution is 501(c)(3))

#### **European Union:**
- Treatment varies by country
- Some jurisdictions treat research grants as non-taxable if used for approved research expenses
- Others may tax as personal income
- ASI provides documentation (Swiss entity tax certificate) to help you navigate local rules

#### **Switzerland:**
- Grants to Swiss residents are generally taxable unless received through a qualifying research institution
- Swiss cantons have different rules, so consult local tax advisor

#### **Other Countries:**
- We work with local tax advisors to provide guidance for common jurisdictions (UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore, etc.)
- If you're in a less common jurisdiction, we'll help you obtain necessary documentation but recommend consulting a local expert

#### **ASI's Role:**
- We provide all tax documentation required by Swiss law
- For US recipients, we issue IRS-compliant 1099 forms
- For non-US recipients, we provide grant award letters and Swiss tax certificates as needed
- **We cannot provide personal tax advice** - please consult a tax professional in your jurisdiction

---

### 4.2 Can researchers from sanctioned countries apply?

This is a complex question that depends on both Swiss law and our own risk management policies.

#### **Swiss Sanctions Framework:**
- Switzerland generally follows UN sanctions but not automatically US or EU sanctions
- As a Swiss entity, ASI is primarily bound by Swiss Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS) regulations
- This provides somewhat broader latitude than US OFAC compliance would

#### **ASI's Eligibility Policy:**

**Eligible:**
- Researchers from any country not subject to UN Security Council sanctions
- This includes most countries globally, including those with US or EU sanctions (e.g., Iran, Cuba) but not UN sanctions

**Ineligible:**
- Countries under comprehensive UN sanctions (currently: North Korea, specific regions under UN arms embargoes)
- Individuals on UN, Swiss, or major international sanctions lists (Specially Designated Nationals, EU consolidated list)
- Entities controlled by sanctioned governments or military organizations

#### **Enhanced Due Diligence:**
For applicants from politically sensitive jurisdictions, we may require additional documentation:
- Proof of no government affiliation or funding
- Letters from academic referees outside the applicant's home country
- Commitment to open-source publication without restrictions
- We conduct these checks carefully to ensure compliance while maintaining accessibility

#### **Why This Matters:**
AI safety research is a global public good. We believe that excluding talented researchers based solely on nationality undermines this mission. However, we must comply with applicable laws and avoid inadvertently supporting sanctioned entities or individuals.

---

### 4.3 What is ASI's intellectual property (IP) policy?

**Simple answer: You own your IP. ASI takes no equity, no royalties, no license rights.**

#### **Researcher Retains All IP Rights:**
- You own any algorithms, methods, software, datasets, or other outputs produced during your grant period
- You can file patents, if desired (though we encourage open approaches)
- You can commercialize your research without ASI involvement
- You can license your work to third parties on any terms you choose

#### **Open-Source Mandate:**
- All ASI-funded research MUST be published open-access
- **Acceptable venues:** arXiv, open-access journals, conference proceedings, public GitHub repositories
- **Timeline:** Within 6 months of completion (or publication in paywalled venue, you must also post a preprint)
- This ensures the AI safety community benefits from ASI-funded work

#### **Patents & Open Source:**
- You CAN file patents and still meet the open-source requirement
- Patent applications are typically public 18 months after filing
- You can choose to dual-license: patent for commercial use, open-source for research use
- **ASI's position:** We prefer copyleft licenses (GPL, Apache 2.0) over patenting, but ultimately it's your choice

#### **University IP Policies:**
- If you're receiving an institutional grant, your university may claim ownership under their IP policies
- This is between you and your institution - ASI has no involvement
- However, the university is still bound by ASI's open-source mandate for the published research

#### **Dual-Use Considerations:**
- If your research has potential dual-use applications (e.g., could be weaponized or enable surveillance), discuss this in your ethics section
- ASI may recommend delayed publication or responsible disclosure practices, but will not prohibit publication
- Open-source mandate applies even for sensitive work, with reasonable timelines for mitigation strategies

### 4.4 What happens if my university claims ownership of grant funds or IP?

This is a common issue with academic research grants. Here's how to navigate it:

#### **Institutional Grant Route:**
If you route the grant through your university, they will apply their standard policies:
- Overhead fees (typically 10-30% in the US, 0-20% in Europe)
- IP ownership according to university policy (often shared or university-owned)
- Approval required for commercialization
- This is standard across most funders, not unique to ASI

#### **Direct-to-Researcher Route:**
If you receive the grant individually (not through your institution):
- You retain 100% ownership of funds and IP
- No institutional overhead
- **However:** Your university may still claim rights if you used their resources (lab space, students, equipment)
- **Best practice:** Clarify expectations with your department/tech transfer office before applying

#### **Negotiating with Your University:**
- Many universities have "research exception" clauses allowing faculty to retain IP for non-commercial work
- Since ASI-funded research must be open-source, you may argue it's non-commercial and request IP retention
- Some universities waive overhead for small grants (<$100K) or purely academic research
- If your university is difficult, consider:
  - Applying as an independent researcher (if you have external institutional affiliations or consulting status)
  - Partnering with a more flexible institution
  - Conducting the research outside your university employment

#### **ASI's Position:**
- We designed the direct-to-researcher option specifically to avoid institutional friction
- If your university is blocking your application, contact us - we may be able to provide template language or negotiate directly with tech transfer offices

### 4.5 What legal protections exist if ASI fails to disburse funds or disputes arise?

Grant agreements are legally binding contracts. Here's your recourse if issues arise:

#### **Contract Enforcement:**
Grant agreement specifies:
- Payment amounts and milestones
- Timeline for disbursement (30-60 days post-award)
- Swiss law as governing jurisdiction
- Arbitration clause for disputes

If ASI fails to disburse funds without cause, you can:
- Request written explanation (ASI board must respond within 14 days)
- Invoke dispute resolution clause (mediation then arbitration)
- Pursue breach of contract claim in Swiss courts

#### **Treasury Backing:**
- ASI maintains a SAT reserve (10% of circulating SAIT) specifically for grant disbursements
- SAT tokens are backed 150% by commodities and stablecoins - there is actual capital behind your award
- Multi-signature treasury controls prevent unilateral withdrawal by any single board member
- Quarterly audits verify reserve adequacy (published publicly)

#### **Dispute Resolution Process:**

**Step 1: Informal Resolution**
- Contact your Grant Program Lead to discuss issue
- Most problems resolved at this level

**Step 2: Formal Complaint**
- Submit written complaint to governance@asi2.org
- Board reviews and responds within 14 days

**Step 3: Mediation**
- Independent mediator (Swiss Arbitration Centre) facilitates resolution
- Non-binding, but often effective

**Step 4: Arbitration**
- Binding arbitration under Swiss Rules of International Arbitration
- Decision enforceable in most jurisdictions under New York Convention

#### **Board Accountability:**
- Board members have fiduciary duties under Swiss law
- Failure to honor valid grant agreements is breach of duty of care
- Board members can be personally liable for bad-faith actions
- Token holders can challenge board decisions (requires 1M+ SAIT to file challenge)

#### **Reputation Risk:**
All grant awards are public. Failure to honor commitments would:
- Damage ASI's credibility with researchers
- Trigger token holder confidence crisis
- Likely result in board turnover
- This creates strong incentive for ASI to uphold commitments

### 4.6 How do I report grant funds on financial disclosures or conflict-of-interest forms?

Many researchers must disclose external funding on university, grant, or journal forms. Here's how to report ASI grants:

#### **Basic Information to Report:**
- **Funder Name:** ASI (Alignment Safety Institute) or full legal name post-incorporation
- **Grant Amount:** Total award in USD equivalent (e.g., $250,000)
- **Grant Period:** Start and end dates (e.g., Jan 2026 - Dec 2027)
- **Purpose:** AI safety research (include project title)
- **Location:** Zurich, Switzerland (post-2026 incorporation)

#### **Entity Type:**
- If asked "Is this a for-profit entity?": Select "Non-profit/Foundation" or "Research Institute" (ASI will be structured as a Swiss foundation analogous to ETH AI Center)
- If asked "Is this a government grant?": No
- If asked "Is this an industry grant?": No (ASI is independent, not affiliated with any AI company)

#### **Conflict of Interest Disclosures:**
ASI grants do NOT create conflicts for most purposes:
- No equity relationship (ASI takes no ownership)
- No commercialization restrictions
- No board seats or advisory roles required
- However, if you're asked to disclose "all sources of research funding," include ASI

#### **Journal Acknowledgments:**
Standard acknowledgment language:
> "This research was supported by a grant from the Alignment Safety Institute (ASI), Zurich, Switzerland. Grant number [ASI-YYYY-XXX]."

If journal asks "Did the funder have any role in study design, data collection, analysis, or manuscript preparation?": Answer "No" - ASI does not influence research direction

#### **University Reporting:**
- If you received the grant through your institution, they will handle reporting
- If you received it directly, you may need to report it on annual conflict-of-interest forms
- Check with your university's research compliance office for local requirements

#### **Documentation ASI Provides:**
- Grant award letter with official letterhead (for your records)
- Tax documentation (1099 or equivalent depending on jurisdiction)
- Official grant number for citation purposes
- Contact information if forms require funder details

### 4.7 What export control or technology transfer restrictions apply?

As a Swiss entity funding fundamental research, ASI operates under different rules than US-based organizations.

#### **Swiss Export Control Framework:**
- Switzerland has its own strategic export controls, generally aligned with international regimes (Wassenaar Arrangement, etc.)
- Fundamental research published openly is typically exempt from export controls
- ASI's open-source mandate helps satisfy these exemptions

#### **US Export Controls (ITAR, EAR):**
- If you're a US person or work at a US institution, you may be subject to US export controls
- Fundamental research exception (FRE) generally applies if research is published and openly accessible
- ASI cannot provide legal advice on US export compliance - consult your institution's export control office

#### **Dual-Use Technology Concerns:**
- If your research could have military or surveillance applications, document this in your ethics section
- ASI may recommend responsible disclosure practices (e.g., notifying potentially affected parties before public release)
- We will not fund research whose primary purpose is weapons development or surveillance technology
- Legitimate safety research that has dual-use implications is acceptable with appropriate safeguards

#### **Publication Controls:**
- ASI requires open publication, but timing can be negotiated for responsible disclosure
- Example: If you discover a critical vulnerability in deployed AI systems, we support coordinated disclosure with affected parties before public release
- Maximum delay: 6 months beyond project completion

#### **For International Collaborations:**
- If your ASI-funded research involves collaboration with researchers in different countries, be aware of:
  - Each country's export control regulations
  - Data protection laws (GDPR, etc.)
  - Institutional policies on international research partnerships
- ASI can provide guidance but you're ultimately responsible for compliance in your jurisdiction

### 4.8 What happens to grant funds if I leave my institution or change employment?

Employment changes during a grant period are common. Here's how we handle them:

#### **For Direct-to-Researcher Grants:**
- Grant follows you to your new position
- No board re-approval needed if you're continuing the same research
- Update your contact information and notify your Grant Program Lead
- May need to update tax documentation if moving to new jurisdiction

#### **For Institutional Grants:**
- More complex - depends on your institution's policies and grant agreement terms
- **Option 1:** Transfer the grant to your new institution (requires agreements from both institutions)
- **Option 2:** Complete the work remotely in collaboration with old institution
- **Option 3:** Negotiate early termination with return of unused funds, apply for new grant at new institution

#### **Process for Institutional Grant Transfer:**
1. Notify ASI immediately upon accepting new position
2. Your new institution must complete KYC/AML verification
3. New institution must agree to ASI grant terms (open-source mandate, reporting requirements)
4. Old institution may retain overhead already collected but cannot charge overhead on transferred balance
5. Board approval required (typically granted within 14 days)

#### **Career Changes (Leaving Academia):**
- If you leave academia to join industry, you can generally complete your grant
- If joining an AI lab, you must maintain research independence (no proprietary constraints on publication)
- If joining a non-research role, discuss with Grant Program Lead - may need to modify milestones or terminate early

#### **Retirement or Extended Leave:**
- If taking sabbatical or extended leave, grant can be paused (maximum 12 months)
- If retiring mid-grant, you can designate a successor researcher (subject to board approval)
- Unused funds returned to ASI treasury if grant cannot be completed

## FREQUENTLY ASKED CLARIFICATIONS

**Q: Do I need to hold SAIT tokens to apply for a grant?**  
A: No. Grant applicants do not need to hold SAIT tokens. Token holders vote on grant finalists, but anyone can apply regardless of token ownership.

**Q: How many grants does ASI award per year?**  
A: This depends on treasury capacity and application quality. Initial target is 20-30 grants per year across all tiers, ramping up as the program matures.

**Q: Can I apply for multiple grants simultaneously?**  
A: You can have one active grant at a time. You may apply for a new grant once you've completed 75%+ of milestones on your current grant, or after your current grant ends.

**Q: What if I disagree with reviewer feedback?**  
A: You can request a formal appeal within 14 days of receiving feedback. Appeals reviewed by independent board member (not the Grant Committee chair). This rarely changes decisions but helps identify evaluation issues.

**Q: Are overhead costs negotiable?**  
A: For institutional grants, overhead rates are set by your institution, not ASI. However, some universities have lower rates for external/international funders - worth asking your grants office.

**Q: Can I name ASI in my university job applications or promotion materials?**  
A: Yes. ASI grants are prestigious competitive awards and absolutely appropriate to highlight in CVs, promotion dossiers, and tenure applications.
